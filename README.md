Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard (Power BI)
Project Overview

The Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard is a data-driven Power BI project designed to analyze and monitor the performance of a hospital’s emergency department. The goal is to provide hospital management with clear insights into patient flow, operational efficiency, and service quality, enabling faster and more informed decision-making.

The dashboard visualizes key healthcare metrics such as patient volume, average wait time, satisfaction score, and referral patterns across departments. It also helps identify trends in demographics, peak hours, and areas for improvement within the emergency room process.

Business Objective

Hospitals face daily challenges in managing high patient volumes and maintaining quality service. This project aims to:

Track daily and monthly patient visits to identify busy periods.

Measure and visualize average wait times to spot delays and bottlenecks.

Evaluate patient satisfaction trends to assess service quality.

Monitor department referrals to optimize staffing and resource allocation.

Deliver interactive dashboards for quick insights and operational transparency.

Project Workflow
1. Requirement Gathering

Defined key performance indicators (KPIs) and business questions with a focus on:

Number of patients per day and per department

Average waiting time before being attended to

Patient satisfaction scores

Referrals and admissions statistics

Age, gender, and racial demographics

2. Data Cleaning and Quality Check

Handled missing values and standardized patient data.

Verified date and time formats to ensure accuracy in time-based trends.

Validated categorical fields such as department, gender, and race.

3. Data Modeling

Built relationships between multiple data tables for a connected data model.

Created measures and calculated columns using DAX to compute KPIs such as:

Total Patients

Average Wait Time

Patient Satisfaction Index

Referral Count

4. Dashboard Development

Developed four Power BI dashboards for comprehensive analysis:

Monthly View:
Displays monthly trends in patient visits, wait times, referrals, and demographics.

Consolidated View:
Provides an overall summary of hospital performance for a selected date range.

Patient Details:
Shows granular data for each patient including demographics, admission status, and department referral.

Key Insights:
Summarizes main findings, highlighting operational inefficiencies and improvement opportunities.

5. Insights and Recommendations

Identified peak days and times for patient admissions to help with staff scheduling.

Detected longer wait times during certain shifts, suggesting workflow adjustments.

Observed correlations between satisfaction scores and waiting duration.

Recommended better resource distribution for departments with high referral rates.

Tools and Skills Used

Power BI – Dashboard creation and data visualization

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Calculations and KPI metrics

Excel – Data cleaning and initial preparation

Data Modeling – Relationships and star schema design

Data Analysis – Trend identification and insight generation

Key Results

Enhanced visibility into emergency room performance metrics.

Identified operational bottlenecks and areas needing improvement.

Supported data-driven decision-making for hospital management.

Improved understanding of patient behavior and satisfaction trends.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the impact of data analytics in healthcare management, transforming raw patient data into actionable insights. Through clear visuals and dynamic KPIs, the dashboard enables hospitals to improve efficiency, reduce wait times, and enhance patient satisfaction.
